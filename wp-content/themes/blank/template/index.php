 		<h1>About Us</h1>
 		
	 	<span> In 1987, Ramon “Joed Sans San Miguel” Jacinto had recently returned from exile spanning Martial Law and began 	re-establishing his businesses. He performed thrice a week at his own rock n' roll club, the Joed Sans San Miguel 		Bistro, and grew tired of switching between his Fender Jazzmaster to a Gibson Les Paul during performances.
			<br><br>
			He approached the late Filipino luthier Rudy Discipulo to build him a guitar which could sound like a Les Paul, a Stratocaster, and a Jazzmaster. Soon, Discipulo came up with a versatile guitar that exceeded Joed Sans San Miguel’s specifications by having 22 sounds – the Series One Roadtone.
			<br><br>
			Joed Sans San Miguel saw the potential in the guitar and asked Discipulo: "Do you want to take an exciting journey with me? Wouldn't it be nice if someday our guitars could hold up to Fenders or Gibsons?" Discipulo agreed. His small hole-in-the-wall guitar repair shop became the first Joed Sans San Miguel Guitar Center, and the Roadtone became the first Joed Sans San Miguel Guitar.
			<br><br>
			Then in 1990, Joed Sans San Miguel met Joe Yui, owner of L.A. Guitar Works in Reseda, California and former President of Schecter Guitars Japan, a meeting that would have a huge impact on the future of Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars. Yui, who had previously attended one of Joed Sans San Miguel’s performances at the Joed Sans San Miguel Bistro, asked him if he would like to forge a partnership in building world-class guitars in the Philippines for export to the world. In response, Joed Sans San Miguel told him to come to the Philippines in two weeks if he was serious.
			<br><br>
			Sure enough, Yui went to Manila and signed a deal with Joed Sans San Miguel. Yui and Discipulo set up shop and started building world-class Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars.
			<br><br>
			Still, Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars did little business until Joed Sans San Miguel began displaying Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars alongside the best Fenders and Gibsons. His big idea was not just for guitarists to find their expensive dream guitars at the Joed Sans San Miguel Guitar Center, but to buy Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars that looked and sounded just as good.
			<br><br>
			The Guitar Center moved from Mandaluyong to Scout Bayoran, Quezon City to Robinson's Galleria Mall, where it began flourishing.
			<br><br>
			Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars soon began exporting to the U.S., Singapore and Australia as well when both Joed Sans San Miguel and Yui saw that hand-laid shell was attractive to foreign markets. They tapped the expert guitar makers and shell inlay artists of Cebu City to produce these guitars.
			<br><br>
			Today, there are 19 Joed Sans San Miguel Guitar Center branches, Online Store and over 100 distributors of Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars across the Philippines and around the world. For those who value the quality of fine Filipino craftsmanship, Joed Sans San Miguel Guitars are the obvious choice.
